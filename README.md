# DILP_ATM
A Dynamic Integer Linear Programming Model for Air Traffic Flow Management Problem
The mathematical modeling minimizes the energy cost-terms that are linked with flight process. 
The model adopts 4D-decision variables that represent the 4D-trajectories of the airplanes (spatial coordinates and time). 
The proposed model will generate an ATM flight planning by minimizing the costs due to flight duration, ground holding, flight cancellation, speed deviations and level alterations. 
The proposed solution could give a more environmentally friendly, energy efficient and cost-effective route planning for ATM procedures.
